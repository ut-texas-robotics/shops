# FormLabs Form3 and Form3BL Startup Guide

This article goes over the FormLabs SLA machines in the DigiFab lab (AHG 1.106). 

## Getting Started

### I. PreForm installation

We have two desktop computers in the DigiFab lab that are available for user usage. These desktops have the required software installed on them, but many users prefer to install the software on their own computers for ease of access. If you do not wish to go through the installation process, proceed to Step II.

+ Download PreForm: https://formlabs.com/software/preform/ (Supports Windows and Mac)


### II. Setting Up a Print in PreForm

PreForm is the slicer software for the Formlabs printers. As with other printer slicers, you will start by uploading your .STL file either by dragging it onto the PreForm screen or by selecting "Add File" on the top bar. 

** add information about using PreForm **

Note the error window on the right side of the screen. The most common issues are a lack of support or a warning against model contact on the print bed. If you get an error regarding cupping, you may need to reorient or redesign your model to account for this. Read more about cupping here: https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Cupping-Blowout?language=en_US

### III. Starting a Print

Once your print file is ready, you will need to connect to the machine via the usb cable on the back of it. If using the desktop workstation, verify that the usb cable is connected to the computer before continuing.

Once connected, you should see the printer name appear on PreForm. The Form 3+ is named "ActiveLoach" and the Form 3BL is named "OvertGharial."

Select which resin material you wish to use if you have not done so already. Verify that the resin selected in PreForm matches both the resin loaded into the printer and the resin currently in the tank. Note that each tank can only ever support one type of resin, so for materials that do not currently have a dedicated tank, a new one will need to be purchased.

### IV. Removing, Cleaning, and Curing Print

After the part has finished printing, it will need to be removed from the print bed.
