					</header>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/EpilogLaser.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>This article goes over the Epilog FusionPro Laser in the DigiFab lab. The laser has a dedicated
						workstation computer next to it that will be used to run cutting operations. If you have been
						granted access to the workstation, you will be able to see the login information at: <a
							href="https://stache.utexas.edu">stache.utexas.edu</a></p>
					<p>Prior to using the Epilog Laser, please familiarize yourself with the locations of the:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fire Extinguisher</li>
						<li>Exhaust Fan Control Knob</li>
						<li>Emergency Stop (On the laser itself)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>and have read over the Laser Safety section.</p>
					<p>The Exhaust Fan Control is next to the south door and can be set between 1 and 10. While
						operating the laser, make sure to set the fan to 10. When finished, turn it down to 5. The
						exhaust fan should never be set below 5 to ensure that air continuously blows. Please remember
						to turn this back down before leaving, once you're finished with the laser cutter.</p>
					<h3>NOTE: Laser Cutter is Only Available from Monday to Friday 9am - 5pm.</h3>
					<h3>Do NOT use the laser outside of approved operation hours.</h3>

					<h2>I. Laser Safety</h2>
					<p>The Epilog Fusion Pro laser cutter has many safety features built into it to ensure user safety,
						however there are still some procedures that should be followed to ensure the safety both of the
						user and of the laser itself.</p>
					<p>Firstly, never operate the laser outside of the approved time frame (Monday to Friday 9am-5pm).
					</p>
					<p>Secondly, never leave the laser unattended while it is running. If you need to leave the laser
						for any reason, make sure to pause the job and wait for the laser to stop moving before leaving
						the laser. The laser cutter should never be in operation without someone monitoring it in the
						room. </p>
					<p>Only cut materials that are either on the approved material list (see below) or have been
						approved by a shop manager. Using unapproved materials can release dangerous chemicals and cause
						damage to the user as well as to the laser.
					<p>Monitor the cutting of material in the laser to ensure that the cut material does not catch fire.
						Note that flames may occasionally come from the laser when cutting, but a continuous flame
						should not exist on a material. This sustained flame indicates that the material itself has
						caught on fire and should immediately be put out. If this happens, either immediately blow out
						the fire or in the case of a larger flame, use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. While
						this event is unlikely, monitoring the cut operation and ensuring safe cutting practices will
						prevent potential fire hazards.</p>
					<p>The Epilog Fusion Pro laser will never fire the laser while the laser door is open. Do NOT try to
						bypass this feature or any other safety features on the laser.</p>
					<p>In the event that the laser needs to be immediately shut down, press the Emergency Stop button
						located directly on the control panel of the laser. This will immediately cut power to the laser
						and cause all functionality to stop. To reset, twist the red button clockwise until it pops back
						up.</p>
					<p>If you notice the laser is cutting abnormally (lower power than usual, making a strange noise,
						etc), contact a shop manager and do not continue to use the laser unless OK'ed by the shop
						manager.</p>
					<p>If you have any further questions about safe operation of the laser, make sure to talk to a shop
						manager to clarify any points of confusion.</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->


					<h2>II. Approved Materials</h2>
					<p>The Epilog Fusion Pro laser is capable of working on a wide range of materials. Below is a list
						of all approved materials. If you have any questions about potential materials that are not
						listed below, contact a shop manager to see if a material is safe to cut on the laser. Do NOT
						use materials that are not approved as they may cause damage to the laser as well as to the
						health of the user by release of dangerous fumes.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Acrylic</li>
						<li>Birch Plywood (Or other Laser Grade Plywood)</li>
						<li>Leather</li>
						<li>Cardboard</li>
						<li>Paper</li>
						<li>Fabric</li>
						<li>Matte board</li>
						<li>Delrin</li>
						<li>Corian</li>
						<li>Glass (Engrave Only)</li>
						<li>Coated Metals (Engrave Only)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Explicitly, the following are NOT allowed to be cut on the laser:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>MDF and Construction Grade Plywood</li>
						<li>PVC and PVC Materials (Such as Vinyl)</li>
						<li>Any material that is known to release toxic fumes when laser cut</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>III. Getting Started</h2>
					<p>To get started, first log into the workstation next to the laser. If already have your laser cut
						file (.svg), feel free to proceed to section V to run your job. Otherwise, proceed to section IV
						to go over how to design your .svg file for laser cutting.</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

					<h2>IV. SVG Design Basics for Laser Cutting</h2>
					<p>The Epilog FusionPro laser uses .SVG files to interpret what to cut and engrave. There are a
						handful of softwares you can use to create these .SVG files, such as CorelDraw, Adobe
						Illustrator and Inkscape.
						Both CorelDraw and Inkscape are available on the laser workstation. Note that CorelDraw is a
						subscription
						based software while Inkscape is free, so if you wish to download one on your personal computer,
						Inkscape may be preferable. Feel free to use whichever vector design software you prefer, but
						for the sake of simplicity, this walkthrough will be using Inkscape
						to design a simple cut/engrave file. Download Inkscape here:</p>
					<p><a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.3/">Inkscape (Windows / Linux / Mac)</a></p>

					<h2>V. Running a Job</h2>
					<p>Once you have designed your part, open the .svg file on the laser workstation. Select File <
							Print < Epilog Fusion Pro to launch the Epilog Dashboard. You should see your part file
							appear on the screen, and if the laser is on, you will see the live video feed from the
							cameras. </p>
							<p>If the laser is not on yet, start by turning the exhaust up to 10 and then turn
								the key on the laser control panel to turn the laser on. The Epilog laser will run a
								short configuration process, after which the digital screen will display "Idle" in the
								botton left corner. At this point, the laser is ready to begin operating.</p>
							<p>Looking back at the Epilog Dashboard, you will see your operation(s) on the right side of
								the page. These operations will be split into Vector and Engrave if applicable. If what
								appears in these sections do not match what you anticipated, double check your .svg
								file.</p>
							<p>*Information about settings for vector and engrave*</p>
							<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

							<h2>VI. Additional Information</h2>
							<p>Note that the laser does not currently have a reservation system. The laser currently
								does not
								get used to the point that this has been an issue, but if finding an available time to
								laser cut
								becomes an issue, contact a shop manager to help resolve this.</p>
							<p>In addition to the standard grid bed that is on the laser, users may prefer to use the
								engraving
								bed, which is mostly solid and very flat. To change beds, users must remove the current
								bed and
								place the new bed on the table, making sure that it sits properly on the laser. When
								done with a
								bed, please replace the standard grid bed for other users. Do not use the engraving bed
								for
								vector cutting operations as it can damage the bed and potentially release unwanted
								chemicals.
							</p>
							<p>Feel free to reach out to a shop manager if you have any further questions about the
								Epilog
								Fusion Pro laser cutter.</p>
