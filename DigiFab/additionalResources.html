					<h2>DigiFab Computing Resources</h2>
					<p>The DigiFab lab has 3 different computers available for users. The three workstations are the 3D
						Printer workstation, the Laser workstation, and the CAD workstation. To login to a respective
						computer, first visit</p>
					<p><a href="https://stache.utexas.edu">stache.utexas.edu</a></p>
					<p>and log in with your UT EID. From here, you should be able to see the login information for your
						respective user (Texas Robotics or Design) for each of the machines. If you are not able to see
						login information for a specific machine, please contact the lab manager to be added.</p>
					<p>The 3D Printer workstation is located next to the FormLabs printers. This computer contains all
						of the slicer software for all of the various printers in the DigiFab lab. It is also located
						next to the FormLabs printers to allow them to connect to it via USB and upload prints. Users
						are welcome to use this printer for all slicer applications. If any additional 3D printer slicer
						applications or updates are required, contact the shop manager to install these softwares.</p>
					<p>The CAD workstation also contains all of the 3D printer slicer softwares. Both the 3D Printer and
						CAD workstations can be used to set up 3D prints. In addition, the CAD workstation has an
						installation of Solidworks and MasterCAM for various design applications. Additionally, Artec3D
						is available for using the Artec Spider 3D scanner. If any additional design software could be
						beneficial, contact the lab manager to see if said software can be installed on the machine.</p>
					<p>The Laser workstation is dedicated entirely to the Epilog Fusion Pro laser. This computer is set
						up to allow vector (.svg) files to be easily printed on the Epilog Fusion Pro without any
						additional setup. This workstation also has installations of Inkscape and CorelDraw for .svg
						design work. </p>

					<p>Additionally, many users also prefer to use their own computers for many of the above features.
						Below is a list
						of all of the free software that can be downloaded on your computer: </p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/">PrusaSlicer (Windows / Linux /
								Mac)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.raise3d.eu/download/">IdeaMaker (Windows / Linux /
								Mac)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://formlabs.com/software/preform/">PreForm (Windows /
								Mac)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.3/">Inkscape (Windows / Linux /
								Mac)</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Downloading these softwares on your own computer are not required, but may make your workflow
						more convenient and prevent other users from modifying your preferred settings.</p>

					<h2>Artec Spider 3D Laser Scanner</h2>
					<p>The Artec Spider laser scanner is a very high resolution (0.1mm) laser scanner that is available
						upon request to users of the DigiFab lab. A training will need to be done for users who wish to
						use the laser scanner, but once trained, users will just need to request the scanner in advance
						as it is not stored in the DigiFab lab.</p>
					<p>There is a small lazy-susan in the lab as well to aid in 3D scanning that users are welcome to
						use.</p>

					<h2>DigiFab Materials Information</h2>
					<p>There are a wide range of materials that can be used in the DigiFab lab. To help those wondering
						which materials to buy, here is a list of machines and materials that they use. Note that this
						is not an exhaustive list, but only a starting point for those not sure what materials are
						available for the various machines in the DigiFab shop. If you have any questions about a
						specific materials (either listed or not), reach out to the lab manager. If using a new material
						that is not listed, make sure to get it approved from the lab manager before using it as
						improper materials can cause potential damage to the machines and/or users.</p>
					<h3>Raise3D Printer Filament</h3>
					<p>For the Raise3D printers, only official Raise3D branded filament is allowed to be used. This is
						to ensure the continued long term use of the Raise3D machines. </p>
					<ul>

					</ul>

					<h3>Prusa Printer Filament</h3>
					<p>For the Prusa printers, a wider array of filaments can be used. Below are some high quality
						materials that work very well on the Prusas, but other brands can be used as well. Just note
						that cheaper filaments tend to be lower quality so it is reccomended to use a well recognized
						brand of filament to prevent jamming or other print issues.</p>
