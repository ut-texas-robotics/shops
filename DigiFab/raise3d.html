					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Raise3D.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The largest printers in the DigiFab shop are the Raise3D printers. The Raise3D Pro2Plus and Pro3
						are high quality FDM 3D printers with removable beds and dual extrusion capabilities. </p>

					<h2>ideaMaker Slicer Walkthrough</h2>
					<h3>ideaMaker Installation</h3>
					<p>IdeaMaker is the slicer software users will use to import, set up, and then export prints for the
						Raise3D printers. If you already have ideaMaker installed or are using a DigiFab workstation
						computer, skip to step II - Importing a Model.</p>
					<p>Install ideaMaker to your local machine: <a href="https://www.raise3d.eu/download/">
							ideaMaker</a></p>
					<p>ideaMaker is supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
					<p>Once you have installed ideaMaker, go ahead and open up the software and proceed to Importing a
						Model. When launching for the first time, you will need to select your printer model and
						settings for this device:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Printer Type: Raise3D Pro2 Plus / Raise3D Pro3 *(Can adjust later depending on which machine
							you are printing with)*</li>
						<li>Extruder Count: 2</li>
						<li>Use Headed Bed: *Leave Checked*</li>
						<li>Left Extruder Filament: [Raise3D] PLA 1.75 mm</li>
						<li>Right Extruder Filament: [Raise3D] PLA 1.75 mm</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Note that all of our printers in the DigiFab lab use 1.75mm filaments.</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

					<h3>Importing a Model</h3>
					<p>To import your model, eithe select 'Import Model' and select your .STL file, or drag and drop
						your .STL file directly onto the ideaMaker screen. If successfully imported, your model should
						be seen in the ideaMaker workspace. The default extruder is the left extruder, but if you wish
						to change this, you can change either in the View tab or by right-clicking with the model
						selected.</p>
					<p>From here, you can rotate or translate your model as needed using the tools located on the top
						toolbar. It may be beneficial to rotate your model to decrease printing time and required
						supports.</p>
					<p>If you are importing multiple models, ensure that they are not touching.
						- When spacing models, it is reccomended to provide at least 10 mm of space (~1 grid square) in
						between each model.</p>
					<p>Verify that all models are placed correctly on the build plate. This can be done by setting the
						*Z* position of each model to 0.</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

					<h3>Slicing a Model</h3>
					<p>Once your model is setup and ready to print, select `Start Slicing`</p>
					<p>From here, you will be presented a variety of standard slicing templates. Note that the higher
						the quality of print, the longer the print will take. Additionally, verify the type of filament
						is correct for each extruder. Proceed with the following instructions to setup print for chosen
						template.</p>
					<p>**Important:** Select either `Raise3D Pro2 Plus` or `Raise3D Pro3` at the top depending on which
						machine you are using. The settings for each printer vary, so it is essential
						to select the correct printer.</p>
					<p>Once you have validated your print settings, select `Slice`</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

					<h3>Exporting a Model</h3>
					<p>Upon slice completion, an estimated time, cost, and filament usage will be provided. At this
						time, use the time estimate to reserve a spot on the google calendar. If you do not have access
						to the shared "AHG DigiFab 3D Printers" calendar, message the DigiFab support team to request
						access.</p>
					<p>Click 'Preview'</p>
					<p>From here, you can scrub through the print layers to validate your print. Take note of the
						estimated filament usage. Each spool on the Pro2-Plus can hold 1kg of filament when new. To
						prevent possible print failure, ensure that there is enough filament left on the spool to
						complete your print.</p>
					<p>Once ready to export, select 'Export to Local Disk' and save to external USB storage device.</p>
					<p>When naming a print, use the following naming convention:</p>
					<h4>YourName_Date_ModelName.gcode</h4>
					<p>By including your name in the print file, other users will be able to more easily reach out to
						you in order in the case that your print fails or runs into some other issue.</p>

					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->
					<h3>Uploading your gcode File</h3>
					<p></p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->
					<h3>Start Your Print</h3>
					<p>Before running a print, make sure you have the printer reserved on the google calendar. Create an
						event named "YourName - NameOfPrinter" and make sure it is on the DigiFab 3D Printers shared
						calendar (The event should turn purple if on the correct calendar).</p>
					<p>If a previous users print is on the bed, feel free to remove it and place it to the side for them
						to come pick up.</p>
					<p>With your gcode uploaded to the printer, use the touchscreen to navigate to Print. From here you
						should be able to see your gcode file and select it. You will see your model as well as some
						additional information about the print. If you are ready to print, select "Print". At this
						point, the printer will begin printing the model. Note that if using the Pro3, a short bed level
						procedure will be run before the print starts.</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->
					<h3>Removing a Finished Print</h3>
					<p>When a print is finished, it will need to be removed from the print bed. Unscrew the two bed
						finger-screws and remove the print bed. On the Pro3, the bed is flexible allowing the part to be
						easily removed without additional tools. On the Pro2Plus, a scraper may be needed to remove the
						part from the bed. When using a scraper, be careful not to damage the bed underneath. Once your
						part is removed, place the bed back and lightly tighten the screws to keep it from moving back
						and forth during a print.</p>
