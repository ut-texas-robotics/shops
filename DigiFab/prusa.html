					<h2>I. PrusaSlicer Installation</h2>

					<p>We have two desktop computers in the DigiFab lab that are available for user usage. These
						desktops have the required software installed on them, but many users prefer to install
						the software on their own computers for ease of access. If you do not wish to go through
						the installation process, proceed to Step II.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Install PrusaSlicer to your local machine (Supports Windows/Mac/Linux): <a
								href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/"> PrusaSlicer</a></li>
						<li>Open PrusaSlicer</li>
						<li>In the top right of the screen, under select the option "Original Prusa i3 MK3S &
							MK3S+" to configure your slicer for the printers in the lab.</li>
					</ul>

						<h2>II. PrusaSlicer Walkthrough</h2>

						<p>To import your model to PrusaSlicer, either drag-and-drop your file into PrusaSlicer, or
							select Add [Ctl+I] to select your file. File must be a .stl filetype.</p>
						<p>If successfully imported, you will see your model on the digital printbed. From here, you
							may wish to use the layout options on the right side of the screen to move/rotate your
							model. You may also import more than one model at a time to print.</p>
						<p>Once your model(s) have been located and oriented, adjust your print settings and verify
							that they are appropriate for your current print. Verify that the filament settings
							matches the type of filament that you intend to print with. If you want, adjust the
							layer height (Print Settings) and infill. Standard layer height is between 0.15-0.2mm
							with 15% infill.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/prusa/modelOnBed.PNG"
								style="width:100%;max-width:400px" alt="" />

							<p>
							<p>If you want more in-depth settings, you can access the full print settings by selecting
								"Print Settings" at the top.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/prusa/PrintSettings.PNG"
									style="width:100%;max-width:350px" alt="" />
								<p>When you are ready to print, select "Slice Now" in the bottom right of the screen.
									This
									will slice your model and prepare the g-code for printing. </p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/prusa/SliceNow.PNG"
										style="width:100%;max-width:400px" alt="" /></span>
								<p>You can scrub through print layers using the orange slider to the side and bottom of
									the
									view screen. If everything looks correct, select "Export g-code" to save the g-code
									for
									the print. This is the file that you will transfer to the printer itself.</p>
								</p>

								<h2>III. Loading and Unloading The Printer</h2>
								<p>Loading filament on the Prusa printers is relatively simple. Any time you plan to
									print,
									verify
									that the filament that you intend to use is the same type that you selected in the
									slicer
									(whether it's PLA, PETG, etc) as different filaments will have different temperature
									requirements. To load your filament, select "Autoload Filament" and select the type
									of
									filament
									you plan to use. Once the extruder heats up to the appropriate temperature, it will
									beep
									and
									display a prompt requesting the user to insert filament, at which point you may do
									so.
									Once
									the
									filament comes into contact with the drive gears, it will begin extruding the
									filament,
									at
									which
									point the user should not add any additional pressure to the filament.</p>
								<img src="../images/prusa/loadfilament.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" />
								<img src="../images/prusa/materialtemp.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" />
								<p>After 10-15 seconds, the printer will beep and display a prompt asking if the
									extruder is
									extruding the correct color. If you want to run more filament through the extruder
									to
									ensure
									that no old material remains, select "No" and it will extrude for a further 5-10
									seconds
									(recommended to do this 1-2 times, especially if changing color or type of
									filament).
									Once
									satisfied, you may select "Yes' and the printer loading operation will be complete.
								</p>
								<img src="../images/prusa/loaded.jpg" alt="Loaded" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" />
								<p>To unload, select "Unload" from the display menu. If prompted, select the currently
									loaded
									material and the printer will begin heating up. Once at the appropriate temperature,
									the
									user
									will be prompted to press the knob to unload. Upon doing this, the printer will
									unload
									the
									filament and beep when complete, at which point the filament can be removed from the
									extruder
									head. Make sure to cut the melted end of the filament to ease loading next time the
									spool is
									used and prevent jamming.</p>

								<h2>IV. Starting A Print</h2>
								<p>Once you have generated the gcode for your print, you can now upload it to one of the
									four
									printers in the DigiFab lab. To do this, you will need to upload the file to the SD
									card
									on
									the
									printer. If you do not have an SD card reader on your computer, there should be a
									USB
									adapter
									next to the printers that you are welcome to use to transfer your file.</p>
								<img src="../images/prusa/sdcard.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" />
								<img src="../images/prusa/startprint.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;max-width:300px" />
								<p>With the gcode file saved, insert the SD card into the left side of the printer. The
									printer
									should begin sorting files, and will then open a list of files on the card. </p>
								<p>(Note:
									when naming files, use the following naming convention:
									"name_date_additionalinformation.gcode")</p>
								<p>
									The list
									is
									organized by most recent, so your file should be at the top of the list. If the
									printer
									is
									already loaded with filament, you can select your print file with the knob and the
									printer
									will
									begin printing.
								</p>
								<p> Make sure the printer is properly loaded before starting a print. If you need help
									loading the machine, see "Step III. Loading and Unloading The Printer"</p>

								<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

								<h2>V. Additional Information</h2>
								<p>Note that for the Prusa printers, users are allowed to use a wider range of filament
									choices than on the Raise3D machines. While users are still allowed to use Raise3D
									branded filaments, they may also choose to use filaments from other brands. Another
									reccomended brand is Prusa's prusament PLA. This material comes in a wide range of
									colors and prints excellently on the Prusa printers.</p>
								<p>The Prusa printers also do not need to be reserved on the Google calendar like the
									larger 3D printers in the lab. If any of the printers are not currently printing,
									users are welcome to start their print on said machine. </p>
								<p>As with all printers, make sure to only use materials that you or your group have
									provided. If you are unsure, either check with your group or do not use and
									unlabelled material. Users are welcome to store their materials in the lab provided
									that they dispose of any finished spools and that they properly label all filaments
									that are stored in the shared space. Be respectful of other users in the space and
									please work to maintain a clean and safe environment for all users.</p>
								<p>If you experience any issues with the Prusa printers, reach out to the lab manager or
									write a problem note on the issue board in the lab so that the machine can be
									repaired. </p>
								<p>Feel free to reach out to
									the lab manager if you have any further questions that were not answered on this
									page. </p>
								<p>Good luck and happy printing!</p>
