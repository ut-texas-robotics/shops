					</header>

					<h2>Equipment Overview</h2>
					<p>The AHG machine shop contains a variety of metalworking equipment. Below is a list of the major
						equipment in the Machine Shop:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HAAS CNC MiniMill</li>
						<li>Birmingham Manual Mill</li>
						<li>Bantam Desktop CNC Mill</li>
						<li>Sharp Lathe</li>
						<li>Drill Press</li>
						<li>Horizontal Bandsaw</li>
						<li>Vertical Bandsaw</li>
						<li>Belt/Disc Sander</li>
						<li>Grinder Wheel</li>
						<li>Chop Saw</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Additionally, the machine shop has a wide variety of handtools, fixturing equipment, and other
						smaller tools. If you have questions about any specific equipment, reach out to the shop manager
						to see if we have what you are looking for.</p>

					<h3>Mills</h3>
					<p>We have three different milling machines in the AHG machine shop, each useful for different
						applications. Make sure to fully review the safety protocols and recieve training before working
						with any equipment.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/machineshop/haas.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The largest mill is the HAAS MiniMill. This is a large CNC mill that is useful for
						creating complex milled components with high precision. The drawback to this machine is that the
						CAM process for preparing the CNC part is fairly intensive, so may not be worth the effort if
						only doing a simple operation.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/machineshop/mill.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The second mill is a manual Birmingham mill with a DRO. This is a more standard metal mill. We
						have a variety of end mills available in the tool drawers next to this mill that should allow
						you to do most jobs, however if there is a specialty part that you need, contact the shop
						manager to see if it can be acquired.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/machineshop/bantam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The last and smallest mill is the Bantam CNC desktop mill. This smaller scale mill is great for
						smaller aluminum milled components. If doing 2D milling operations, this machine is able to
						interpret vector images (like the Epilog Laser in the DigiFab lab) to cut parts. It is also
						capable of taking more complex 3D CAM milling jobs like the HAAS. Note that this mill is not
						capable of milling steel, but it can mill aluminum and potentially other soft metals. Always
						check with the shop manager to confirm if a material works with this machine.</p>
					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

					<h3>Metal Lathe</h3>
					<p>We also have a large metal lathe for turning metal parts. If you have round components with
						radial symmetry, the lathe may be the ideal tool for your operation.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/machineshop/lathe.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<hr class="major" /> <!-- Visual Section end line -->

					<h3>Cutting Equipment</h3>
					<p>The AHG Machine shop also has a variety of equipment for cutting materials including both a
						horizontal and vertial bandsaw as well as a chop saw. These tools allow a user to easily and
						quickly cut metal materials.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/machineshop/bandsaws.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<h2>Safety Protocols</h2>
					<p>When working in the machine shop, it is essential to follow the safety protocols for the safety
						of yourself, people around you, as well as the equipment you are using. The following safety
						protocols are always in effect in the AHG Machine Shop and should be followed whenever in the
						space:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Keycard access is only provided to shop managers. If you wish to enter the machine shop,
							contact a shop manager to set up a time.</li>
						<li>A shop manager/supervisor must be present anytime larger equipment is being used.</li>
						<li>Proper PPE when any equipment is in use (Safety goggles, long pants, no short sleeves, tied
							back long hair).</li>
						<li>No food or drink in the shop.</li>
						<li>When using any heavy equipment (mill, lathe), 3 users must be present in the machine shop
							during use. Not all users must be trained on the equipment (aside from the one(s) actually
							using the equipment), but must be present in the space for safety. A lab manager/supervisor
							counts as one of the three.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Additionally, users should not use any equipment they do not feel safe using. If you have any
						questions when using equipment, ask the shop manager and they will be happy to help instruct you
						how to use it safely.</p>
